Ratio1 - formely known as **Naeural Edge Protocol** (**Naeural** for short) is the Operating System for Artificial Intelligence powered by AI and Blockchain technologies. Our mission at Ratio1 is to democratize AI by establishing a network of shared resources, simplifying the development and deployment of AI applications from inception to execution. Ratio1 empowers anyone to access and capitalize on AI's potential through an extensive array of applications hosted within our user-friendly ecosystem, driving revenue for active participants. With our **â€œAI power to the people"** motto, we envision a future in which computers and mobile devices worldwide provide AI solutions for a range of tasks and projects which matter to individuals, large and small organizations alike.

Ratio1 aims to address key technical and economic challenges by offering readily accessible AI solutions that are cost-effective through trustless micro-transactions. This approach eliminates barriers to entry, as it only requires consumer or retail computer devices equipped with the Ratio1 Edge Node software. Our solution caters to the requirements of developers, compute providers, and individuals without extensive AI expertise, ensuring widespread accessibility and usability.

Our ecosystem establishes a utility blockchain network wherein AI processing nodes will:

- Collaborate to execute tasks aligned with real-life use cases;
- Generate revenue for the node owners who contribute services to the network;
- Directly generate income for participants in the service provider network, including developers, maintainers, and other stakeholders.
